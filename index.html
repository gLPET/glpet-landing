      <p>My main vision is to become OG, and similar projects (gmichi, giko, selfie e.t.c.) — but with a different message.</p>
      <p>I want to show people that in the meme market, most projects become fixated on a single character.</p>
      <p>Holders start depending on it — waiting for what the owner will do, what the dev will announce, waiting for content... and so on.</p>
      <p>But I want to show that people can become the source of content themselves — they can shape the narrative however they want: funny, creative, emotional, or completely chaotic.</p>
      <p>They don’t need to wait for a new TikTok video or a push from some big page. Just imagine: 100 people hold the token ➝ each of them edits a photo ➝ you get 100 unique images. That alone can trigger a mini-viral moment. Now imagine 1,000 people… That’s a new kind of Covid, right? 😹</p>
      <p>The feed on Twitter would be flooded. Sure, some will try to profit from it — but regular holders will keep posting and pushing.</p>
      <p><strong>No more just “buy and wait.” This is “buy and create.”</strong></p>
